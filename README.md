# personal-site (WIP)

A simple repo to track my personal site and portfolio.

live site is at https://joshjm.github.io/#/

Project is a vue app, with vuetify componets and vue-router, and vuex. 

Also employs Vanta for the cool hero page, and plotly.js for a few graphs. 
I also pull in and clean some data from the github api. Github hasnt enabled cors, so you have to do a bit of a round about way to recreate that cool commit plot on your profile. Stay tuned for when I recreate the look with SVG and release an npm package... 

## Installation
`npm i` to install, and `npm run serve` to start the dev server.
`./deploy.sh` to build and push to the deploy branch.
If you dont have a deploy key then you are out of luck though.
